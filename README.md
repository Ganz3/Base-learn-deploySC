# Solidity Smart Contract Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of Solidity smart contracts that I wrote and tested using Remix IDE. 
The goal of this portfolio is to showcase my understanding of fundamental Ethereum development concepts, 
including variables, functions, arrays, mappings, inheritance, ERC standards, and contract interaction.

## 📌 List of Smart Contracts

All contracts are located in the contracts/ folder.

### ✔ Beginner / Foundation Concepts
- BasicMath.sol — simple arithmetic operations in Solidity.
- ControlStructuresUT.sol — examples of if/else, loops, and logical operations.
- ArrayExercise.sol — working with dynamic and fixed arrays.
- FavoriteRecord.sol (Mapping) — basic CRUD operations using mappings.
- AddressBook.sol — storing and retrieving addresses on-chain.

### ✔ Intermediate Concepts
- GarageManager.sol — struct management, array of structs, modifiers.
- Imports.sol — demo contract showing import statements in Solidity.
- OtherContract.sol — interacting with another contract.
- ErrorTriageExercise.sol — exploring require/assert/revert.

### ✔ Object-Oriented Programming in Solidity
- InheritanceUT.sol — demonstrates inheritance and override keywords.

### ✔ Token Standards (ERC)
- ERC20.sol — simplified implementation of ERC-20 token.
- ERC721.sol — minimal NFT contract based on ERC-721 standard.
- MinimalToken.sol — smallest possible token example.

### ✔ Utility Contract
- SillyStringUtils.sol — simple library for string manipulation.
